# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is a hands-on implementation of handwritten digit recognition using the **MNIST dataset**. It demonstrates how machine learning models can identify digits (0â€“9) from images.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** MNIST (70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, 28x28 pixels each)
- **Objective:** Train a model to classify handwritten digits with high accuracy
- **Tools & Libraries:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow/Keras, Google Colab
- **Notebook:** `copy-of-mnist-dwdm_project.ipynb`

## Features

- Data exploration and visualization
- Preprocessing of images for model input
- Building a neural network model with Keras
- Model training, evaluation, and accuracy analysis
- Prediction on sample images

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Run all cells step by step
3. Observe the model's performance and prediction results

## Outcome

- Understand the workflow of a machine learning project
- Learn how to handle image data, train models, and evaluate performance
- Predict handwritten digits using the trained model
